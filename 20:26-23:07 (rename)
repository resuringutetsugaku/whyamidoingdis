Ok. I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm keeping notes. Date is 26/04, time is 20:16.
Information about me: male, 25, atypical schizophrenia, 6 classes of education.
My native language is russian, for the moment I'm also learning nihongo through duolingo.
I have no clues about programming.
But you can call me セーラーウラヌス and thus, being a reincarnation of Haruka Tenno, I have a power of Uranus and just can't fail this mystery!
well, I mean of course I can, because of my IQ of 60 and intensive competition from eesti collegues, but I'm doing this mostly for fun.

First of all: I don't know if I'm on a time limit or not. rus.delfi.ee told me, that I have 1h 30min to solve this mystery.
So I failed already.
But because I do it for fun, my time limit is 27/04/2021 06:00 AM. I started my work at 20:26. Right now is 22:26 and I'm redacting this txt file, because I need it to be
naicu.
I have a weak heart and insomnia problems, but I can't sleep without my 10mg of Zolpidem. My awake time is ~16:00 25/04/2021.
Results of my ~2 hours of work are: 
a) to solve this mystery I need to understand basic, let's say, Python;
b) The killer is a sergeant, but you should arrest Annabel if she's an illegal immigrant. That's not my final word, but if Big Brother need my answer now, then this is it;
c) I have excessive txt information;
d) As I understand it now, I have no photo or video information.
e) くそ くらえ ばかやろう。

Observations:
By using simple crime-scene.txt + CTRL+F + CLUES combo-wombo I'm getting some minor information from a sergeant, but it is simply not enough for a murder accusations. 
Hints and manual sheet wants me to go for a certain direction, but it's like playing psi-build in Underrail: that's just not fun. 
What's important and what I really should to do is:
1. Combine all txt files in one single file for a better cheesing of CTRL+F spell.
2. not to die from a heart break. because it sometimes feels like I really can. that's secondary tho
3. To have fun! that's, though, completely not important.
